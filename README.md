# FR Counter Discord Bot

## What does it do?
The FR Counter bot just counts the amount of messages that contain fr in it. It isn't case sensitive and it doesn't count FR's from before it is added.

## Why?
IDK, just felt like making it.

**Also this is hosted through [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io), which is free, so it might be laggy if in too many servers.**
