# FR Counter Discord Bot

## What does it do?
The FR Counter bot just counts the amount of messages that contain fr [^1] in it.
It doesn't count FR's from before it is added.

## Why?
IDK, just felt like making it.

**Also this is hosted through [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io), which is free, so it might be laggy if in too many servers.**

[^1]: Isn't Case Sensitive.
